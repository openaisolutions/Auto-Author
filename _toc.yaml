# Add a brief description of the book, targeted at calculus students
description: |
    This part fiction story, part math textbook, aims to teach calculus using interactive ipynb with markup cells for the story and python cells for the examples to enact stories set in a Star Wars-like universe. This book should cover all the core calculus from textbooks like Calculus: Early Transcendentals by James Stewart. Examples for calculus should be in ipynb cells for Python while the story text should be in Markdown cells. This will be a comprehensive calculus by examples book with a fictional story to tie the examples and exercises together.
